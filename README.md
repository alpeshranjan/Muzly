# Free Music Streaming Web App ðŸŽ§

This is a full-stack web application designed to provide free music streaming with the added functionality of creating and managing personalized playlists. The platform allows users to search, play, and organize their favorite tracks easily, delivering a smooth and intuitive music experience.

The app leverages the **YouTube Data API** to fetch music files, ensuring users have access to a vast library of songs in real-time. The front-end features a sleek, modern UI crafted using **React.js** and styled with **HTML** and **CSS** to prioritize simplicity and ease of use. The dynamic, minimalist design ensures the platform is not only visually appealing but also highly functional.

On the back-end, the application is powered by **Node.js** and **GraphQL**, ensuring efficient data handling and a seamless user experience across the platform. The combination of technologies enables fast loading times, smooth interactions, and reliable music streaming.

## Key Features:
- **Free music streaming** from a vast online library
- **Create and manage playlists** for a personalized experience
- **Real-time music fetching** through the YouTube Data API
- **Minimalist, responsive UI** that focuses on user-friendly navigation
